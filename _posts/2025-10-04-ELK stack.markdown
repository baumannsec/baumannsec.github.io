# Elastic Stack Overview

Evolved from being called **ELK Stack**, due to the inclusion of **Beats**.  
The **Elastic Stack** can function as a standalone **SIEM** platform or serve as the core technology behind **Security Onion 2**.

## Elasticsearch

According to [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch):

    "Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fine-tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease."

Elasticsearch is designed to efficiently search and analyze petabytes of data at a relatively low cost compared to traditional relational databases.  
It uses **ES|QL (Elasticsearch Query Language)** — a structured query language built specifically for searching and correlating data within Elastic.

## Logstash

**Logstash** serves as a **server-side data processing pipeline**.  
It can ingest data from a variety of sources, transform it as needed, and send it to a target repository such as **Elasticsearch**.<sup>1</sup>

Originally, Logstash was the primary data shipping engine within the Elastic Stack, handling both data collection and transformation.  
However, due to its heavy resource usage, lighter options were later introduced to handle specific data collection tasks.

## Collecting Telemetry: Beats and Elastic Agent

As the Elastic ecosystem evolved, **Beats** was introduced as a set of lightweight, single-purpose data shippers.  
While Logstash sends data to a stash and can perform transformations, it consumes significant system resources.  
**Beats**, on the other hand, is efficient and simply collects and forwards data.

Each Beat focuses on a specific type of telemetry:

- **Filebeat** – Ships log files  
- **Winlogbeat** – Ships Windows Event Logs  
- **Packetbeat** – Ships network data  
- and many more for other types of data

All Beats use the **libbeats** library, written in **Go**, to securely and reliably transmit data.

With **Elastic Agent**, you can collect all forms of data from anywhere with a single unified agent per host —  
One thing to install, configure, and scale.<sup>2</sup>

## Visualization: Kibana

**Kibana** provides the user interface for the Elastic Stack.  
It allows analysts to visualize, search, and interact with the data stored in Elasticsearch.  
Through dashboards, charts, and query tools, Kibana makes it easy to identify patterns, monitor network activity, and conduct investigations in **Security Onion**.
